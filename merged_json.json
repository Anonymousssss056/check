I always wanted to be a\ndetective which was inspired by one of my favourite films. But\nthe fortune took me to another way, to the journey of Information\nTechnology. I have completed my Diploma in Engineering in IT in\n2014 A.D. and Bachelor Honors in IT in 2018 A.D. I started working\nas a software developer in 2017 and currently working at Ekbana\nSolution.  \nSince childhood, I was very open minded and was less\noverprotected by parents. I still remember roaming the whole day\nwith friends when i was 5-6 years old. I guess other children wouldn\u2019t\ngo out without the permission of their parents. Because of this I\ngot huge opportunities to learn and earn people beyond my school\nfriends. I was one of the active students in school like engaging in\ndancing, sports, and other curriculum activities. Since childhood\nI always go on evening walks which makes me feel fresh and\nhappening...\nThough I love exploring and social life, I am really shy in nature and\nless talkative. I always wanted a break after some periods of working\nlife. A phase of my life came  where I was able to manage my travel\ncost, and the desire of exploring new places, love towards nature led\nme to trek and travel to different parts of Nepal. I began to travel 3\ntimes a year taking a break from work and study. And I will keep on\ntraveling till my legs are with me.  \nBeyond study, travel, family and work, I am a social worker as well.\nIt\u2019s been more than 7 years contributing my time and effort for the\nsake of community, peace and humanity through the Rotaract Club\nof Bhaktapur. Rotaract has really brought a big positive effect in my\nlife. It gave me opportunities to utilize my spare time for good things,\nearned me a huge group of nice people, taught me to become a\nleader, taught me to learn from failure and success. It really helped\n\u00a0 Page 1 of 3\u00a0 \u00a0\nmy life to be surrounded by positive energies. I am always committed\nto all aspects of my life and I believe life is better when all these\nthings are balanced. \nAnyways thanks for visiting my profile, visit my website\nwww.rabigorkhai.com.np and hope may be you will find some\ninformation you needed and yeah keep in touch.\nExperience\nEkbana\nSoftware Engineer (php)\nJune 2018\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (4 years 7 months)\nEKbana Solutions Pte.

Some of the algorithms are\nelegant but far from the coolest algorithms I know. And you have to\nbe mathematically inclined to appreciate algorithms in the first place.\nBut the things you can do with machine learning are endless. When\npeople ask me what I do? I normally answer I predict the future.\nWhich is entirely correct. I make concrete verifiable predictions about\nthe future and measure myself, I usually fair pretty well.\nMy innate interest in Artificial Intelligence began when I found myself\nfascinated by the projects done by seniors in one of the hackathons I\nattended. Curiosity is the first and the foremost quality which drives a\nperson towards learning new things. My interest, passion, dedication\nin learning AI, enabled me to acquire significant knowledge on\nPython and mathematics behind every ML algorithm.\nI substantiated my knowledge by opening an Instagram page and\na website \u201cgraspcoding.com\u201d based on AI. My prodigious appetite\nfor guiding others started from the moment I published my first\npython ebook on Amazon Kindle. In the meantime, I created tutorials\non various projects and shared them on the Website as well as\nInstagram.\nExperience\nFusemachines\nMachine Learning Engineer Associate\nAugust 2021\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (1 year)\nKathmandu, B\u0101gmat\u012b, Nepal\nhttps://graspcoding.com/\nAdmin and Content Creator \nJuly 2020\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (2 years 1 month)\nKathmandu, B\u0101gmat\u012b, Nepal\n\u00a0 Page 1 of 2\u00a0 \u00a0\nGrasp Coding is the official page handle by graspcoding.com.

I'd also assist other internal teams (frontend and\nbackend) in integrating the smart contracts with the DApp.\nMy main takeaway from Ibriz was the extensive knowledge I obtained out of\nbuilding blockchain projects, most notably NFTs and Games from scratch to\nproduction alongside a talented team.\niBriz.ai\nBlockchain Developer\nMay 2020 - July 2020 (3 months)\nEducation\nKathmandu University (KU)\nB.Sc., Computer Science \u00b7 (November 2017 - June 2022)\nAmarsingh Higher Secondary School, Pokhara\n+2, Science \u00b7 (2015 - 2017)\nGandaki Boarding School\nSLC, Science \u00b7 (2008 - 2015)\nPage 2 of 2\n\f\n", {"entities": [[8, 52, "LINKEDIN LINK"], [75, 85, "SKILLS"], [86, 94, "SKILLS"], [95, 105, "SKILLS"], [121, 163, "CERTIFICATION"], [164, 179, "CERTIFICATION"], [180, 231, "CERTIFICATION"], [232, 300, "CERTIFICATION"], [301, 357, "CERTIFICATION"], [372, 406, "AWARDS"], [407, 443, "AWARDS"], [444, 459, "NAME"], [460, 480, "SKILLS"], [483, 491, "SKILLS"], [494, 498, "SKILLS"], [501, 505, "SKILLS"], [508, 512, "SKILLS"], [515, 518, "SKILLS"], [521, 530, "SKILLS"], [555, 564, "LOCATION"], [987, 995, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [996, 1011, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [1012, 1025, "WORKED AS"], [1051, 1058, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [1765, 1791, "WORKED AS"], [1819, 1834, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [2901, 2909, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [2910, 2930, "WORKED AS"], [2953, 2961, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [2973, 2998, "UNIVERSITY"], [2999, 3022, "DEGREE"]]}], ["\u00a0 \u00a0\nContact\nwww.linkedin.com/in/zakariyah-d-a4b241162  (LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nCloud Applications\nCloud Development\nNetwork Architecture\nLanguages\nArabic  (Professional Working)\nSomali  (Native or Bilingual)\nEnglish  (Native or Bilingual)\nCertifications\nCloud Architecture: Core Concepts\nCybersecurity Foundations\nLearning REST APIs\nCySA+ (CS0-001) Cert Prep: 5\nIdentity and Access Management\nLearning PowerShell\nZakariyah D.\nCloud Engineer at HSBC\nLondon Area, United Kingdom\nExperience\nHSBC\nCloud Engineer\nApril 2021\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (1 year 4 months)\nFDM Group\nCloud Computing Consultant \nApril 2020\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (2 years 4 months)\nDWP Digital\nUSS User Access Admin\nJanuary 2021\u00a0-\u00a0March 2021\u00a0 (3 months)\nJohn Lewis & Partners\nSelling partner\nJuly 2018\u00a0-\u00a0April 2020\u00a0 (1 year 10 months)\nWhite city\nEducation\nUniversity of Westminster\nInternational business with Arabic\u00a0 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(2016\u00a0-\u00a02019)\n\u00a0 Page 1 of 1", {"entities": [[12, 53, "LINKEDIN LINK"], [77, 95, "SKILLS"], [96, 113, "SKILLS"], [114, 134, "SKILLS"], [145, 175, "LANGUAGE"], [176, 205, "LANGUAGE"], [206, 236, "LANGUAGE"], [252, 285, "CERTIFICATION"], [286, 311, "CERTIFICATION"], [312, 330, "CERTIFICATION"], [331, 390, "CERTIFICATION"], [391, 410, "CERTIFICATION"], [411, 423, "NAME"], [486, 490, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [491, 505, "WORKED AS"], [529, 544, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [546, 555, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [556, 582, "WORKED AS"], [607, 623, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [625, 636, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [637, 658, "WORKED AS"], [687, 695, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [697, 718, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [719, 734, "WORKED AS"], [760, 776, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [799, 859, "UNIVERSITY"], [872, 876, "YEAR OF GRADUATION"]]}], ["\u00a0 \u00a0\nContact\nwww.linkedin.com/in/anil-tripathi-\nb7631570  (LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nCustomer Service\nStrategic Planning\nLeadership ANIL TRIPATHI\nAgribusiness Specialist\nNepal\nSummary\nExperienced Branch Manager with a demonstrated history of working\nin the non-profit organization management industry.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. \u2022 WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. \u2022 The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized \u2022 Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.
